        *Disclaimer: Earth cannot be held responsible for any unforeseen
        consequences or side effects that may arise from visiting or interacting
        with its inhabitants. Such side effects may include but are not limited
        to confusion, excessive sweating, a general sense of bewilderment, and
        uncontrollable laughter. Visitors may also be exposed to unforeseen
        hazards such as natural disasters, alien invasions, or rogue artificial
        intelligence, as Earth cannot guarantee protection against them (two
        types of artificial intelligence helped write this disclaimer). If
        visitors experience a sudden onset of existential dread, difficulty
        understanding human social norms, or a persistent feeling of being
        watched, they should consult a local human immediately. Please note that
        Earth reserves the right to change its rules, customs, and entire way of
        life without notice, so visitors are advised to keep an open mind and a
        sense of humor at all times. Thank you for choosing Earth as your travel
        destination. Remember, we're all just floating on a giant rock hurtling
        through space together, so let's make the most of it!
